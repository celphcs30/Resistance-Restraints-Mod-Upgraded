  <description>Unbreakable prisoners? Unwaveringly loyal captives? Not anymore. Prisoner Restraints introduces new methods to break down resistance and a progression system that can make unwaveringly loyal prisoners recruitable.

Features:
- Restraining table: Immobilizes prisoners and slowly reduces resistance
- Humiliation cage: Strips dignity and apparel, moderate resistance reduction
- Sensory collapser: High-intensity deprivation chamber for unwaveringly loyal prisoners
- Chemfuel bath: Expedited resistance reduction through chemical burns

Vanilla Nutrient Paste Expanded Support:
All restraint beds can now accept the nutrient paste dripper facility. Place a dripper adjacent to the bed head to automatically feed prisoners via the paste network.

Vanilla Chemfuel Expanded Support:
The chemfuel bath can now be connected to the chemfuel pipe network for automatic refueling.

Release System:
Prisoners can be manually released from any restraint device using the "Release prisoner" button. Wardens will automatically remove restraints and free the prisoner, allowing them to move normally.
