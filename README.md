# Prisoner Restraints Upgraded

A fork of [Prisoner Restraints](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3434403034) by SilkCircuit, updated for RimWorld 1.6.

## About

Unbreakable prisoners? Unwaveringly loyal captives? Not anymore. Prisoner Restraints introduces new methods to break down resistance and a progression system that can make unwaveringly loyal prisoners recruitable.

## Features

* **Restraining table** - Immobilizes prisoners and slowly reduces resistance. Hunger and sleep needs drop to negligible levels, ensuring minimal upkeep.
* **Humiliation cage** - Strips dignity, privacy, and apparel. Reduces prisoner resistance at a moderate rate. Effective, though prolonged use risks mental collapse.
* **Sensory collapser** - High-intensity deprivation chamber that bombards subjects with disorienting stimuli. Triggers early stages of Stockholm syndrome and only affects unwaveringly loyal prisoners.
* **Chemfuel bath** - Expedited resistance reduction through chemical burns. Requires frequent refueling to maintain effectiveness.

## Requirements

* RimWorld 1.6
* [Harmony](https://github.com/pardeike/HarmonyRimWorld) (mod dependency)

## Vanilla Nutrient Paste Expanded Support

All restraint beds can now be connected to the paste network to automatically feed prisoners. This integration is added automatically when [Vanilla Nutrient Paste Expanded](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2920385763) is installed.
